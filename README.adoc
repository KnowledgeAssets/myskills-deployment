This project provides templates for deployments of the MySkills application.

== Using Docker Compose

The subdirectory `docker-compose` contains a template to deploy MySkills using Docker Compose. This is an ideal solution for local development and testing environments. *It is NOT recommended for production use!*

=== Prerequisites

* Docker 17.06.0 (or higher)
* Docker Compose 1.17.0 (or higher)
* Git Client

=== Deployment with pre-built images

IMPORTANT: We do not publish Docker images so far. This deployment assumes that you have pre-built the images `myskills/webapp:latest` and `myskills/server:latest` on the Docker daemon which will run the containers!

. Clone this Git repository.
. Open a terminal in the subdirectory `docker-compose`.
. Set the environment variable `SERVER_DOMAIN` to the web domain where the MySkills WebApp will be hosted. For example: `SERVER_DOMAIN=myskills.your-domain.com`
. Set the environment variable `SERVER_ADMIN` to the admin's e-mail address. For example: `SERVER_ADMIN=admin@your-domain.com`
. Start the deployment: `docker-compose -p myskills up -d`
. Verify the container state: `docker-compose -p myskills ps`

=== Deployment from sources

The MySkills Server and WebApp can be deployed directly from sources using the bash script `deploy-from-sources.sh`. The script fetches the sources from GitHub, compiles the applications and builds their Docker images. Then it starts the Docker Compose deployment like described above.

. Clone this Git repository.
. Open a terminal in the subdirectory `docker-compose`.
. Set the environment variable `SERVER_DOMAIN` to the web domain where the MySkills WebApp will be hosted. For example: `SERVER_DOMAIN=myskills.your-domain.com`
. Set the environment variable `SERVER_ADMIN` to the admin's e-mail address. For example: `SERVER_ADMIN=admin@your-domain.com`
. Optionally set the environment variable `BUILD_CONTEXT_DIR` to the directory where the sources and build caches should be stored. Default is `$HOME/myskills`.
. Start the deployment: `./deploy-from-sources.sh`
. Verify the container state: `docker-compose -p myskills ps`

TIP: After the first deployment you must to configure the `MySkills` realm in the KeyCloak server. Go to http://<your-domain>:9000/auth and follow the steps described in the section <<Configuring authentication using KeyCloak>>.

== Configuring authentication using KeyCloak

. Install the KeyCloak server.
. Log in to the administration console.
. Create a new realm named `MySkills`.
. Create a new client within the `MySkills` realm:
  * Client ID: `myskills`
  * Client Protocol: `openid-connect`
  * Root URL: (Base URL where the MySkills WebApp is hosted), e.g. `http://myskills.your-domain.com`
. Configure the client settings:
  * Access Type: `public`
  * Standard Flow Enabled: `off`
  * Implicit Flow Enabled: `on`
  * Valid Redirect URIs:
  ** `/`
  ** `/index.html`
  ** `/silent-refresh.html`
  * Web Origins: (Base URL where the MySkills WebApp is hosted), e.g. `http://myskills.your-domain.com`
. Configure the mappers of the client scope `profile`:
  * For the mapper `username` set the Token Claim Name to `user_name`
. Configure users and groups as needed.
